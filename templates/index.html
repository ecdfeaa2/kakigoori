			<h2>Upload an image once, use it everywhere on the web</h2>
			<p>
				Kakigoori is an image management service to publish images on the web. Upload it once, and Kakigoori will create versions of the image, optimized for the web (AVIF, WebP, Jpegli). You can also request for custom sized images, of which the JPG/PNG versions will be generated on the fly, and the other versions will be created within a few minutes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Kakigoori's images are stored by Backblaze and distributed by Cloudflare. No matter where you are in the world, images stored by Kakigoori will display as fast as possible.

			<h2>Q&A</h2>

			<details>
				<summary>Who is using Kakigoori?</summary>
				My websites (remilia.ch and ecdfeaa2.moe) all have their images stored on Kakigoori! I also use Kakigoori on some projects I worked on professionaly.
			</details>

			<details>
				<summary>Can I upload images to Kakigoori?</summary>
				Well... currently, I'm kind of concerned about opening upload to anyone (I wouldn't want to have Backblaze sending me a nasty bill for using too much storage, or having them send me a gentle email to ask me why the fuck I'm hosting illicit content ^^).<br>
				So, my default answer is no, but if you're really interested to use Kakigoori, either self-host Kakigoori yourself, or if you want to use this hosted version and you're a friendly person, please send me an email to <a href="mailto:remilia@remilia.ch">remilia@remilia.ch</a> and I will see what I can do for you!
			</details>

			<details>
				<summary>How private is Kakigoori?</summary>
				I'm not storing IPs, I'm not doing statistics, I'm not showing you any cookie banner because I'm not storing any, so on my side, I would say it's pretty compliant with privacy standards.<br>The only people that may know about you loading images from Kakigoori is Cloudflare, but at this point, with how much market share they have over the big websites of the Internet, they already know enough abut you ^^
			</details>
            
            <details>
				<summary>Is Kakigoori open-source?</summary>
				Yes! Please see <a href="https://github.com/ecdfeaa2/kakigoori">the GitHub project for that!</a>
			</details>

			<details>
				<summary>Who is behind Kakigoori?</summary>
				I'm Remilia Da Costa Faro, your friendly nearby software developer and non-binary trans woman!
			</details>

			<details>
				<summary>... why the name Kakigoori?</summary>
				I was hungry when I created the project, and it was warm enough that I wanted some form of kakigoori.<br>
				Oh, and about the sunflowers?<br>
				They're pretty, I love them! (That's the only reason)
			</details>

			<details>
				<summary>How can I contact you if I want?</summary>
				My email is always open (<a href="mailto:remilia@remilia.ch">remilia@remilia.ch</a>). Do note I may be a bit slow to reply, as replying to people scares me a bit ^^.
